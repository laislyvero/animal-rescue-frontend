   <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    
    <p> In a Few Wordsâ€¦</p>
    <p>RescueME! is the only animal welfare charity in Kenya protecting animals from neglect and abuse. We<br/>
    rely on the help of volunteers, voluntary fundraising and donations to carry out our important work, <br/>
    so your support is invaluable to us!</p>
    
   <p> Since the society's formation one fifty years ago, RescueME! has grown and is well known for animal <br/>
   rescue and rehabilitation. Our headquarters on Okore Road, Milimani were established in 1972 when land was <br/>
   purchased and kennels and a small cattery were built. RescueME! also has offices providing relief to <br/>
   animals in Eldoret and Kakamega.</p>
    
   <p> We firmly believe that educating younger generations is the best way to raise standards of animal care<br/> in the future and encourage school children to visit the shelter and learn about animal welfare. <br/>In the last twenty years we have seen an encouraging change in attitudes to animals, though there is <br/>still a long way to go. </p>
